# Q-Data

Q-Data is a one-day workshop, collocated with SIGMOD, that explores the potential of quantum computing and quantum-inspired hardware accelerators for data processing and data management.

## Motivation

Whereas quantum computing started out as a purely theoretical concept, the last few years have seen a "Cambrian explosion" of first-generation quantum hardware. Various companies, including the likes of Google, IBM, and Intel, as well as startup companies like D-Wave, IonQ, and Rigetti Computing, are now producing hardware devices that implement quantum computing using various technologies. At the same time, the recent advances in quantum computing have inspired a new generation of classical hardware accelerators, offered commercially by providers such as Fujitsu, Toshiba, and 1Qubit, that mirror the interfaces and internal processes of quantum computers. These accelerators, including digital annealers, optical Ising machines, and FPGA-based simulations of quantum computation, obtain approximate solutions for extremely large, combinatorial optimization problems quickly.

Using quantum computing and related technologies has never been easier. Several software frameworks have recently appeared that make solving a diverse range of problems using quantum computers easier. At the same time, multiple Cloud providers nowadays offer quantum computing as a service, making the technology accessible to broad shares of the population.  Taken together, these developments have recently spawned a flurry of research in various communities, ranging from operations research to machine learning, and aimed at analyzing the transformative potential of quantum computing for specific use cases.
