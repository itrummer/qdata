# Q-Data

Q-Data is a half-day workshop, collocated with SIGMOD 2024, that explores the potential of quantum computing and quantum-inspired hardware accelerators for data processing and data management.

## Motivation

Whereas quantum computing started out as a purely theoretical concept, the last few years have seen a "Cambrian explosion" of first-generation commercial quantum hardware culminating from decades of foundational research. Players, including the likes of Google, IBM, and Intel, as well as startup companies like IQM, D-Wave, IonQ, and Rigetti, are now producing hardware devices that implement quantum computing using various technologies. At the same time, the recent advances in quantum computing have inspired a new generation of classical hardware accelerators, offered commercially by providers such as Fujitsu, Toshiba, and 1Qubit, that mirror the interfaces and take inspiration from internal processes of quantum computers. These accelerators, including digital annealers, as well as GPU- and FPGA-based simulators of quantum computation, obtain approximate solutions for extremely large, combinatorial optimization problems quickly.

Using quantum computing and related technologies has become conveniently possible with standard IT interfaces. Several software frameworks have recently appeared that make solving a diverse range of problems using quantum computers easier. At the same time, multiple cloud providers nowadays offer quantum computing as a service, making the technology accessible to broad shares of the population. Taken together, these developments have recently spawned a flurry of research in various communities, ranging from operations research to machine learning, and aimed at analyzing the transformative potential of quantum computing for specific use cases. 

## Topics of Interest

Topics of interest for the workshop include (but are not limited to):
- Enhancing database system components (e.g., query optimizer, query scheduler, transaction scheduler, authentication and integrity manager) with quantum computing and quantum-inspired accelerators
- Data processing systems that integrate quantum-based and quantum-inspired accelerators
- Quantum machine learning for autonomous database management, database tuning, workload management, and learned indexes
- Approaches for data exploration, discovery, and integration based on quantum computing and quantum-inspired hardware accelerators
- Formal analysis and experimental evaluations assessing the potential of quantum computing for specific use cases in data processing and data management
- Vision papers describing novel database system designs and novel use cases in data processing and management enabled by quantum computing
- Quantum computing libraries and programming interfaces for database systems
- Quantum computing enhanced data exploration, discovery, and integration
- Domain-specific approaches exploiting quantum computers and quantum-inspired accelerators for data analysis (e.g., in finance or health care)

## Important Dates

All deadlines are 11:59 PM Pacific Time:
- Submissions: March 30, 2024
- Notifications: April 30, 2024
- Camera-Ready: June 1, 2024
- Workshop Date: June 9, 2024

## Submission Instructions

We accept three kinds of papers:
- Full papers with a length of up to 12 pages (excluding references)
- Short papers with a length of up to 6 pages (excluding references)
- Abstracts with a length of one single page (including references)

Abstracts describe ideas and projects at very early stages. For long and short papers, we consider the following categories:
- Algorithms: The primary contribution lies in algorithms that allow solving problems that are relevant to the database community on quantum computers or quantum-inspired accelerators. Long papers are expected to provide significant experimental or formal analysis results evaluating the proposed algorithm.
- Systems: The primary contribution lies in proposing new architectures or frameworks that use quantum computing or quantum-inspired accelerators to address problems in data processing and management. Long papers are expected to evaluate the implementation of the proposed system thoroughly.
- Experiments: The primary contribution lies in experimental analysis, quantifying properties of existing or novel algorithms that are at least partially executed on quantum computers or quantum-inspired accelerators (or use corresponding simulators). Long papers are expected to provide a more detailed experimental analysis.

Accepted papers and abstracts in any of the aforementioned categories will receive a presentation slot at the workshop (five minutes for abstracts, 15 minutes for short papers, and 25 minutes for long papers).
